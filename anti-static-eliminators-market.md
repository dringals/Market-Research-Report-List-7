<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Eliminators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type Static Eliminators</li><li>Induction Type Static Eliminators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static eliminators market comprises two main types: contact type static eliminators and induction type static eliminators. Contact type static eliminators work by directly touching the charged surface, transferring charges and neutralizing static electricity. Induction type static eliminators, on the other hand, use an electrostatic field to neutralize charges from a distance without physical contact. Both types are crucial in industries like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and packaging, where static control is essential for product quality and safety.</p></p>
